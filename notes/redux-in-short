STORE
	we create a single state object for the complete application called store.
	this store takes function as an argument called reducer-function.
 	the state object can only be updated using actions that are handled by this reducer function.

REDUCER FUNCTION
	the reducer function takes in the current state and an action object as an argument.
	it returns a new state based on the action.type mentioned.
	whenever an action is dispatched, it is handled by the reducer function.

ACTION
	action is the only way to update the properties in the store.
	it is an object with a property TYPE which tells the store what changes are to be made
	this action object is used with a function called dispatch provided by the store.

DISPATCH
	dispatch takes an action object.
	it tells the reducer function to make changes according to the TYPE property in the object

STORE-FUNCTIONS
	store.getState() returns the current state of the object.
	store.subscribe() is triggered everytime there is a change in the store.
	to unsubscribe, save the store.subscribe() to a variable and call it.
